My fork of `https://github.com/4bcx/no-style-please`

I have done these:

- Remove contexts (I guess I don't need it.)
- Replace list_pages with recent_pages (list_page will display 'about pages' and some other pages located in the 'content' directory, which is unexpected.)
- Support [Katex](https://katex.org/)
- Support [Music ABC notation](https://abcnotation.com/)
- Support Multilingual sites
